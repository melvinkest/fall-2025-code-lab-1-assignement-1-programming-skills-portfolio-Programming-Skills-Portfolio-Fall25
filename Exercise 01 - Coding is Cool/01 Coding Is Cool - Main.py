# Declaring the variables
# Note: I include a space at the start of ' is' and ' Cool'.
# If I didn't, the final sentence would be squashed together like "CodingisCool".
word1 = 'Coding'
word2 = ' is'
word3 = ' Cool'
# Using string concatenation to combine the variables and print the phrase:
print(word1+word2+word3)
